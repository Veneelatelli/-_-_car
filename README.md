Project Overview
The aim of this project is to predict the price of used cars based on different attributes like car model, year, engine size, mileage, and more. The dataset is processed, analyzed, and used to train machine learning models, with a focus on regression algorithms such as Linear Regression.

Objectives:
To predict the price of a used car using machine learning algorithms.
To explore the relationships between various car features and their impact on price.
To evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R².
Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

Car Model: The make and model of the car.
Year: Year of manufacture.
Engine Size: Engine capacity (in liters).
Mileage: Distance driven (in kilometers or miles).
Fuel Type: Type of fuel the car uses (Petrol, Diesel, etc.).
Transmission: Type of transmission (Manual, Automatic).
Price: The target variable representing the car's price.
You can use any used car dataset for this project. Make sure to format it appropriately for the scripts to process.

Requirements
This project uses the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn


eatures
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and scales features.
Visualization: Visualize relationships between car features and price using matplotlib and seaborn.
Modeling: Trains a Linear Regression model to predict car prices.
Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the model using metrics like MSE and R².
Model Development
The following steps were taken to develop the model:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables such as fuel type and transmission.
Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Model Training: A Linear Regression model was trained using scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the model was measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

Results
The Linear Regression model achieved an MSE of X.XX and an R² score of X.XX on the test set, indicating that the model is able to explain XX% of the variance in car prices.

Key Insights:
Year and Mileage are important features that strongly influence car prices.
Engine Size and Fuel Type also have significant impacts on the price.
